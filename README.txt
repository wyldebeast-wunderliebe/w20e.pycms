w20e.pycms is Yet Another CMS. Why, for the flying spaghetti monsters
sake? Well, you know how it goes. You use Plone for some years, find
out that when your favourite tool is a hammer, all problems have a
rather strong tendency towards looking like a nail... Then Pyramid
comes along, giving you the best of Plone (ZODB, Zope Component
Architecture, ZCML, Chameleon, etc.) for creating lightweight
apps. Then you need a Page with wysiwyg... then you need
search... sharing. Then you wake up with a basic CMS in your
hands. May as well share it so you can decide for yourself whether it
is worth your while.

Anyway, read more in the documentation within the package if you like.
