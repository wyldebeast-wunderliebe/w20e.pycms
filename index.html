<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>w20e.pycms is Yet Another CMS, but without the acronym. 
Why, for the flying spaghetti monsters sake another CMS? Well, you
know how it goes. You use Plone for some years, find out that when
your favourite tool is a hammer, all problems have a rather strong
tendency towards looking like a nail... Then Pyramid comes along,
giving you the best of Plone (ZODB, Zope Component Architecture, ZCML,
Chameleon, etc.)  for creating lightweight apps. Then you need a Page
with wysiwyg... then you need search... sharing. Then you wake up with
a basic CMS in your hands. May as well share it so you can decide for
yourself whether it is worth your while.</p>

<p>Anyway, read more in the documentation within the package if you like.</p>

<h2>For whom..?</h2>

<p>w20e.pycms is not for the faint of heart, nor for people that cannot
read Python code, hate programming, think that the use of XML for
configuration is sooo 1990, are convinced that Windows 95 was the best
OS ever or would preferrably use a rocket launcher to deal with vermin
in the kitchen. It <em>is</em> on the other hand, for those that rank
fuckit.js among the best JS libraries ever, enjoy Terry Pratchett,
love buildout en ZCML and think that beer is so much more that just a
breakfast drink.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Our little CMS gives you a framework to build your sites upon, if
you're not targeting the enterprise market. If you do, be gone (to the
plone.org site)!</p>
