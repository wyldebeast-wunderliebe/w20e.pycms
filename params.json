Well, you\r\nknow how it goes. You use Plone for some years, find out that when\r\nyour favourite tool is a hammer, all problems have a rather strong\r\ntendency towards looking like a nail... Then Pyramid comes along,\r\ngiving you the best of Plone (ZODB, Zope Component Architecture, ZCML,\r\nChameleon, etc.)  for creating lightweight apps. Then you need a Page\r\nwith wysiwyg... then you need search... sharing. Then you wake up with\r\na basic CMS in your hands. May as well share it so you can decide for\r\nyourself whether it is worth your while.\r\n\r\nAnyway, read more in the documentation within the package if you like.\r\n\r\n## For whom..?\r\nw20e.pycms is not for the faint of heart, nor for people that cannot\r\nread Python code, hate programming, think that the use of XML for\r\nconfiguration is sooo 1990, are convinced that Windows 95 was the best\r\nOS ever or would preferrably use a rocket launcher to deal with vermin\r\nin the kitchen. It _is_ on the other hand, for those that rank\r\nfuckit.js among the best JS libraries ever, enjoy Terry Pratchett,\r\nlove buildout en ZCML and think that beer is so much more that just a\r\nbreakfast drink.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nOur little CMS gives you a framework to build your sites upon, if\r\nyou're not targeting the enterprise market. If you do, be gone (to the\r\nplone.org site)!\r\n\r\nPyCMS gives you:\r\n\r\n* ZODB for storing data\r\n* blobstorage\r\n* user & group management\r\n* search, using repoze.catalog (optional)\r\n* creating and maintaining pages\r\n* an easily extendable framework for new content types\r\n* a lot of ZCML configuration\r\n* CMS design based on (Twitter) Bootstrap\r\n"}
