Internationalisation is not trivial when using Pyramid. Well, it is,
but it finding out what to do isn't. Here it is then: you'll need to
install setuptools extras for doing gettext thingies:

  easy_install Babel lingua

Now you should have some extra commands when running
  
  python setup.py --help-commands

Create a base pot file in <egg>/locale/<app name>.pot

<app name> should be the name of your egg.

Extract messages from your files (based on settings in setup.py):

  python setup.py extract_messages

Settings can be done through an entry like:

  message_extractors = { '.': [
    ('**.pt', 'lingua_xml', None),
    ]},

Ok, create a locale, based on your pot file:

  python setup.py init_catalog --locale nl

Use in templates as per directions on the Chameleon site. Make sure
your domain is correct, e.g. the name of your egg.
