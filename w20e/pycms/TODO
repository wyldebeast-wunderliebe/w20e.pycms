* Maybe use w20e.forms for add_* forms?
* on post, only dl.config and surrounding div's need to be sent
* Make specific layout configurable (use .fixed class)
* refresh user screen when user added
* Add admin view without being a formview? Really?
* enable reset id
* move local actions to CMS (from hitman)
* make indexes for catalog configurable through zcml
