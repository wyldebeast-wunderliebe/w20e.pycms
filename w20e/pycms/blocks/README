How to add new blocks
=====================

* create block class, extending Block
* create block view, exending BlockView
* create template
* create add_form/edit_form in block py
  - make sure to add hidden field that holds type id
* add to configure.zcml in .blocks
* add to parser registry
* add it to the page actions
  (this should really get the data from the registry)

Yeahyeah, that's a lot of steps... but it really takes only minutes,
once you know the drill.
