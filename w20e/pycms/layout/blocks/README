Blocks
======

The layout system of w20e.pycms uses blocks to fill slots on a
page. The blocks comprise the actual content. A slot is filled simply
from the blocks defined for it on the edit page, in the order in which
they were added. The blocks system is extendable, like almost anything
in w20e.pycms.


How to add new block types
--------------------------

* create a block class, extending w20e.pycms.layout.blocks.base.Block
  or at least implementing w20e.pycms.layout.blocks.interfaces.IBlock.
  The render method should be implemented and return the rendered
  html representation of the block.
* Add the configuration to your zcml, like so:
  
  <pycms:block
      name="text"
      factory="w20e.pycms.layout.blocks.text.Text"
      />

  where the 'name' attribute is a unique name for your type, and the factory
  is the producer of your block class.

* Create an XML form according to w20e.forms, that holds the edit/add form
  for your block. This should be named like <block type id>.xml
