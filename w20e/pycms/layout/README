PyCMS layout
============

PyCMS page rendering (or: what you get to see when you visit a page)
is base on predefined page layouts. A layout defines one or more
(well, actually zero or more...) slots, that are used to render pieces
of content, like images, text, etc. Those pieces are called
'blocks'. What you do is:

 * define a page layout using ZCML (what else..?) by a unique name,
   a template and an interface, and the slots:

    <pycms:layout
        name="base_layout"
        template="w20e.pycms:templates/base_layout.pt"
        interface="w20e.pycms.layout.interfaces.IBaseLayout"
        >

      <pycms:slot
          name="main"
          blocks="text"
          />

    </pycms:layout>

 * Create the template for this layout. This template should call the slots
   for this page like so:
  
     <tal:repeat repeat="block view.get_blocks('main')">
       <tal:replace replace="structure block.render()" />
      </tal:repeat>

In edit mode, a layout can be set using the 'layout' action. Only one
layout can be set. Picking a new layout will discard the existing
one. Data however will persist, so you can share slots between
layouts, or go back to the previous layout.
